React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP called XHP. An example of JSX code A React component under the Flux architecture should not directly modify any props passed to it, but should be passed callback functions that create actions which are sent by the dispatcher to modify the store. The action is an object whose responsibility is to describe what has taken place: for example, an action describing one user following another might contain a user id, a target user id, and the type USER_FOLLOWED_ANOTHER_USER.[29] The stores, which can be thought of as models, can alter themselves in response to actions received from the dispatcher.",

Many expressed concerns that Facebook could unfairly exploit the termination clause or that integrating React into a product might complicate a startup company's future acquisition.[45]",
